# Computational Model of Knuckle joint

Here I written a python code to design the knuckle joint, and you can find the all dimension of the knuckle joint just entering your requirements. we converted the whole code to JS and give a proper HTML page to evaluate the Dimension of the Knuckle joint.
We also make CAD model of knuckle joint and run the simulation for observing the strain in the joint.

I am very excited to explore how  machine learning and python like technologies can help in Mechanical engineering 
domain.

With knowledge of both domain i find myself in a better position.

Here give a look to my project:-

## Tech Stack





Python, HTML Solidworks, Matlab
